## Welcome to the UA Interview Process

We will be looking at an existing project that needs a lot of work. This is a basic project that has several issues. Your job is to inspect the code as you would a pull request and refactor, fix, consolidate, reorganize how you see fit. There are no wrong answers to this other than it still has to work once you are finished.

Walk us through the code and change it how you would structure an application. Explain what steps you take and why you are inclined to take them.
